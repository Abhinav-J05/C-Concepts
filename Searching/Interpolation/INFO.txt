/*
* Interpolation Search technique
* ------------------------------
*
* This approach is based on binary search and is modified version of the same.
* The essence of interpolation search is, instead of searching for middle element,
* try to make a guess of where the target can be using linear interpolation.
*
* Conditions for this approach :
* 1. Array must be sorted
* 2. Uniformly distributed
*
* Step 1 :
* Find out how far the target is from home ( start index ).
* 
* Step 2 :
* Divide by total range.
*
* Step 3 :
* Get the index as,
* 
*                (x - arr[low])
* =>   low +  ------------------------ . (high - low)
*           (arr[high] - low[start])
*
